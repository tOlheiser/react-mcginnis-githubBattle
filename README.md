# Notes

## Project Setup

1. Navigate to the project directory in the node cli.
2. Initialize a new npm project and creates a package.json. 
* run *npm init -y*
3. Install packages from the npm directory.
* run *npm install react react-dom*
4. Create a .gitignore file so that if people clone your project, they don't pull the node_modules & dist folder which would be generated anyway. 
5. Create an 'app' folder.
